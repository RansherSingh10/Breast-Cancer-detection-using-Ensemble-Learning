# Breast-Cancer-detection-using-Ensemble-Learning
Using the dataset found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source, this ensemble learning model was created using the relevant machine learning models and combining them alongside bagging and boosting. 
The predicitons made were on the FNA reports of patients which is extremely safe and reliable compared to the widely used mamograms. The predictions were accurate over 96% of the times.
